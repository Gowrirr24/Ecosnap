## 🌱 ECOSNAP  

A fun eco-friendly game promoting sustainability through engaging and interactive gameplay.

ECOSNAP was developed at the **"Hack for Impact: Innovate for a Better Tomorrow"** hackathon organized by the IEEE IA/IE/PELS Joint Chapter, Kerala.

After an initial online screening round, the final event was conducted at the **College of Engineering, Attingal**, with selected teams — including ours — participating.

## 🎮 Concept  

ECOSNAP encourages users to capture their daily sustainable activities and participate in a rewarding gaming environment.

The idea is to build a gamified sustainability platform that:

- Rewards users for eco-friendly actions  
- Uses leaderboards to encourage healthy competition  
- Provides milestone-based achievements  
- Motivates consistent sustainable behavior  

Users upload photos of their activities, and ECOSNAP monitors them and assigns points accordingly.
